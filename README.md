  Hi! I'm Daniel, and this is my portfolio website where I show off my projects and tell you about myself!

  🎯 What This Website Does

  This is like my digital business card! It shows:
  - Who I am - A person who loves building websites
  - What I've built - Cool projects I've made
  - My thoughts - Things I think about when making websites
  - How to contact me - So we can chat about making cool stuff together!

  🧸 Why I Built My Own Design Library (Like LEGO Blocks!)

  You know how LEGO blocks can build anything? I made my own "website LEGO blocks" because:

  🎨 It's Like Having My Own Crayon Box

  - Instead of using someone else's colors, I made my own!
  - Every button, text, and picture looks exactly how I want
  - It's like having a magic crayon that always draws the same shade of blue

  🔧 Building Blocks That Fit Together

  - I made pieces like <Button>, <Text>, and <Section>
  - They all work together like puzzle pieces
  - When I want to change something, I only need to change it in one place!

  🚀 It Makes Building Websites Super Fast

  - Instead of drawing a new button every time, I just use my <Button> block
  - It's like having a stamp instead of writing the same word over and over

  💭 My Thoughts About Code

  Code Should Be Like a Good Story

  - Easy to read and understand
  - Each part has a clear purpose
  - Anyone should be able to follow along

  Keep Things Simple

  - Don't use big fancy words when small ones work
  - Make one thing do one job really well
  - Clean up your toys (code) when you're done!

  Be Kind to Future You

  - Write code like you're leaving notes for a friend
  - Tomorrow-you will thank today-you for being clear
  - Comments are like sticky notes that explain tricky parts

  🏗️ How I Built This

  The Foundation (Like Building a House)

  1. React - The main tool that makes everything work
  2. TypeScript - Helps catch mistakes before they happen
  3. Styled Components - Makes everything look pretty
  4. My Design System - All my LEGO blocks working together

  The Special Features

  - Accessibility First - Everyone can use my website, no matter how they browse
  - Mobile Friendly - Works great on phones and big computers
  - Fast Loading - Nobody likes waiting for slow websites!
  - Dark Mode - Easy on your eyes when browsing at night 🌙
  - Interactive Design System - Browse all components in the StyleGuide

  🎨 Why Simple Design Works

  Think of your favorite toy. It's probably not the one with a million buttons and lights that confuse you. It's the simple one that just works perfectly.

  That's what I did here:
  - Clean colors that are easy on your eyes
  - Clear text that's easy to read
  - Simple navigation so you never get lost
  - Fast loading because waiting is boring

  🤝 What Makes Good Code (The Secret Recipe)

  Like Organizing Your Room

  - Put similar things together
  - Give everything a clear name
  - Clean up regularly
  - Make it easy to find stuff later

  Like Writing a Letter

  - Use clear, simple words
  - One idea per paragraph (function)
  - Check your spelling (no bugs!)
  - Make it nice to read

  Like Being a Good Friend

  - Be consistent and reliable
  - Don't surprise people in bad ways
  - Help others understand what you're doing
  - Share your toys (code) with others
